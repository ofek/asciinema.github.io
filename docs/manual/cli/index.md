# asciinema CLI

__asciinema__ (aka asciinema CLI or asciinema recorder) is a command-line tool
for recording terminal sessions.

Unlike typical _screen_ recording software, which records visual output of a
screen into a heavyweight video files (`.mp4`, `.mov`), asciinema recorder runs
_inside a terminal_, capturing terminal session output into a lightweight
recording files in the [asciicast](../asciicast/v2.md) format (`.cast`).

The recordings can be replayed in a terminal, embedded on a web page with the
[asciinema player](../player/index.md), or published to an [asciinema
server](../server/index.md), such as [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), for further
sharing.

Recording is as easy as running this command in your shell:

```sh
asciinema rec demo.cast
```

Check out the [quick start guide](quick-start.md) for installation and usage
overview.

Notable features:

* [recording](usage.md#asciinema-rec-filename) and
  [replaying](usage.md#asciinema-play-filename) of
  sessions inside a terminal,
* [light-weight recording format](../asciicast/v2.md), which is highly
  compressible (down to 15% of the original size e.g. with `zstd` or `gzip`),
* integration with [asciinema server](../server/index.md), e.g.
  [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), for easy recording hosting.
