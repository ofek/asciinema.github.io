# asciinema player

__asciinema player__ is a web player for terminal session recordings.

Unlike typical web _video_ players, which play heavyweight video files (`.mp4`,
`.mov`), asciinema player plays lightweight terminal session recordings in the
text-based [asciicast](../asciicast/v2.md) format (`.cast`), such as those
produced by [asciinema recorder](../cli/index.md).

<div class="player" id="player-manual-player-intro"></div>

The player is built from the ground up with JavaScript and
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ([WASM](https://webassembly.org/)), and is
available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/asciinema-player) and a
[standalone JS
bundle](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player/releases/latest).

You can use it on any HTML page - in a project documentation, on a blog, or in a
conference talk presentation.

It's as easy as adding a single line of Javascript code to your web page:

```javascript
AsciinemaPlayer.create('demo.cast', document.getElementById('demo'));
```

Check out the [quick start guide](quick-start.md) for basic setup overview.
