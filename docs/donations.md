# Donations

asciinema is free and open-source software. Sustainability of its development
relies on donations and sponsorships. Please help the software project you use
and love.

Your support:

- allows asciinema lead developer, [Marcin Kulik](https://hachyderm.io/@ku1ik),
  to spend more time on implementing requested features, fixing bugs and helping
  [the community](community.md),
- covers maintenance costs of running asciinema's main hosting site,
  [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), such as servers, domains, DNS, backup
  storage space, etc, keeping it free for everyone,
- grants you a "Supporter" badge on your asciinema.org user profile.

## Corporate sponsorship

If your company uses asciinema, either in a product or internally, please
consider giving back by becoming a sponsor.

Also, if your product's target audience overlaps with asciinema userbase
(sysadmins/ops, developers), sponsoring the project lets you reach them by
getting your logo/link on [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), in [Github
repositories](https://github.com/asciinema), or on [asciinema
blog](https://blog.asciinema.org).

Other than funding you can support the project by providing free

operational costs of running [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org).

use-case and you wish it did, consider this option. It's a win-win!
