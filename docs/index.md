__asciinema__ is a suite of tools for recording, replaying, and sharing terminal
sessions. Its typical use cases include creating tutorials, demonstrating
command-line tools, and sharing reproducible bug reports. It focuses on
simplicity and interoperability, which makes it a popular choice among computer
users working with the command-line, such as developers or system
administrators.

asciinema is free and open-source software (FOSS) created by [Marcin
Kulik](https://hachyderm.io/@ku1ik). The source code is available at
[github.com/asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema).

To learn more about the project itself, read through the [About](history.md)
section. It explains [how asciinema works](how-it-works.md), how to engage with
[the community](community.md), what [integrations](integrations.md) people have
built around the project, and last but not least, how to [support the
project](donations.md).

To get up to speed with asciinema follow the [getting started
guide](getting-started.md). It's a short, hands-on tutorial, which demonstrates
what's possible, and leaves you with a good high-level overview of the tool.

To get deeper navigate to the [manual](manual/index.md), which covers
installation, configuration and usage of each asciinema component
([CLI](manual/cli/index.md), [player](manual/player/index.md),
[server](manual/server/index.md)). It also includes the specification of the
[file format](manual/asciicast/v2.md) used by asciinema.
